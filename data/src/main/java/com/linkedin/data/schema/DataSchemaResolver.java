/**
 * A {@link DataSchemaResolver} is used to resolve names to {@link NamedDataSchema}s.
 * <p>
 * A {@link SchemaParser} uses {@link #existingDataSchema(String)} to determine if a name has already
 * been resolved to a {@link NamedDataSchema}. The returned {@link NamedDataSchema} may not
 * be complete or well-formed due to circular references.
 * <p>
 * A {@link SchemaParser} uses {@link #findDataSchema(String, StringBuilder)} to request the
 * resolving an unresolved name to a {@link NamedDataSchema}. This may be done by searching
 * jar files or directories for files whose file names computed from the provided name
 * similar to how Java resolves class names to source or binary files.
 * <p>
 * The contract between a {@link SchemaParser} and its {@link DataSchemaResolver} requires
 * the {@link SchemaParser} to invoke {@link #bindNameToSchema(Name, NamedDataSchema, DataSchemaLocation)}
 * to bind all possible names (its declared name and aliases) to a newly constructed {@link NamedDataSchema}
 * before {@link SchemaParser} attempts to lookup or resolve names referenced by the {@link NamedDataSchema}.
 * This means that when the name is bound, the {@link NamedDataSchema} is incomplete. This contract
 * is required to implement circular references.

// D2URI is a proto representation of com.linkedin.d2.balancer.properties.UriProperties. Note that a D2 UriProperties is
// is designed to hold all the announcements of a cluster, which is why it's represented as a map of URI to data. The
// UriProperties class is reused wholesale for serialization to write the data to ZK, which is why all fields are
// actually maps, even though these maps only ever have one key in them. It is clear from the implementation of
// ZooKeeperServer and ZooKeeperAnnouncer that there cannot ever be more than one URI in one ZK announcement, therefore
// this new proto representation does not need to share the same shortcomings and can, instead, represent things more
// linearly.
// linearly. Note that since a URI can announce to multiple partitions, this is still represented as a map to capture
// the weights for each partition.
//
// Here is a sample ZK announcement in JSON serialized from a UriProperties for additional clarity on the fields that
// are represented as maps when they do not need to be:
//	{
//		"weights": {
//			"https://foo.stg.linkedin.com:18792/Toki/resources": 1.0
//		},
//		"partitionDesc": {
//			"https://foo.stg.linkedin.com:18792/Toki/resources": {
//				"0": {
//					"weight": 1.0
//				}
//				"1": {
//					"weight": 2.0
//				}
//			}
//		},
//		"uriSpecificProperties": {
//			"https://foo.stg.linkedin.com:18792/Toki/resources": {
//				"com.linkedin.app.version": "0.1.76"
//			}
//		},
//		"clusterName": "Toki"
//	}
//
// And here is what the corresponding D2URI would look like for this announcement:
//	{
//		"cluster_name": "Toki",
//		"uri": "https://foo.stg.linkedin.com:18792/Toki/resources",
//		"partition_desc": {
//			"0": 1.0,

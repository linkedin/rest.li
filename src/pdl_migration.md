## Why Use PDL?

PDL as a schema definition language was designed to be read and written by humans, making it a much more enjoyable experience for developers
to define their service's models. PDSC, despite its syntax being simply a subset of JSON, cannot boast this human-readability factor.

In addition to its inherently more readable syntax, PDL also features some extra shorthand which developers can leverage to write less and
make their schemas more readable for others. See [below](#notable-differences-between-pdsc-and-pdl) for more information on this.

## How to Convert Schemas to PDL

If you have an existing project with PDSC schemas, converting everything to PDL is pretty straightforward.
Rest.li's Gradle plugin provides a task `convert<sourceSet>ToPdl` which will automatically convert your schemas for you.
It should be noted that this task verifies the converted schemas against the original schemas.
If this verification fails, then the whole conversion will be aborted.

The minimum required version for running this task is `28.1.3`, though it's always recommended to use the latest version
so that all bug fixes and improvements are picked up.

The following command will convert every PDSC schema in your project to PDL.

```
gradle convertToPdl
```

You can selectively migrate only one particular module of your project with the following:

```
gradle :<moduleName>:convertToPdl
```

This task also takes in a few options:

```
gradle :<moduleName>:convertToPdl \
    [-PconvertToPdl.reverse=(true|false)] \
    [-PconvertToPdl.keepOriginal=(true|false)] \
    [-PconvertToPdl.preserveSrcCmd]
```

| Property | Type | Description
|----------|------|-------------
| `convertToPdl.reverse` | boolean | If true, converts PDL schemas back to PDSC (and vice versa if false).
| `convertToPdl.keepOriginal` | boolean | If true, keeps the source schemas (the source schemas are deleted by default).
| `convertToPdl.preserveSrcCmd` | string | Command which is run for each file, useful for running special VCS logic. The command should be a template string containing `$src` and `$dst` as references to the source and destination filename, respectively (e.g. `gradle convertToPdl -PconvertToPdl.preserveSrcCmd "/usr/bin/svn mv $src $dst"`).

## Notable Differences Between PDSC and PDL

You can find in-depth documentation on [PDSC syntax](/rest.li/pdsc_syntax) and [PDL syntax](/rest.li/pdl_schema) elsewhere,
but this section will point out notable differences between PDSC and PDL.

### PDL is More Java-Like

PDL is arguably much more human-readable than PDSC because of its Java-like syntax.
Whereas reading and writing PDSC is like reading and writing plain JSON, reading and
writing PDL is like reading and writing a Java interface definition.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PDSC</th>
    <th>PDL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "type" : "record",
  "name" : "Foo",
  "namespace" : "com.example.models",
  "doc" : "Foo is a record.",
  "fields" : [ {
    "name" : "x",
    "type" : "int",
    "default" : 1
  }, {
    "name" : "y",
    "type" : {
      "type" : "map",
      "values" : "long"
    },
    "doc" : "y is a field.",
    "optional" : true
  }, {
    "name" : "z",
    "type" : {
      "type" : "enum",
      "name" : "Fruits",
      "symbols" : [ "APPLE", "BANANA", "PEAR" ]
    },
    "default" : "PEAR",
    "someAnnotation" : 123
  } ]
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
    <td>
{% highlight pdl %}
namespace com.example.models

/**
 * Foo is a record.
 */
record Foo {
  x: int = 1,

  /**
   * y is a field.
   */
  y: optional map[string, long],

  @someAnnotation = 123
  z: enum Fruits{ APPLE, BANANA, PEAR } = "PEAR"
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Import Statements

In PDSC, all references to types outside the schema's own namespace have to be written as fully-qualified type names.
PDL, on the other hand, features imports statements (similar to those in Java) which allow the user to specify types
that can be referenced by their simple name rather than their full name. This can help to reduce the amount of
redundant data written in schemas that refer to the same type numerous times.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PDSC</th>
    <th>PDL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "namespace": "com.example.models",
  "type": "record",
  "name": "Redundancies",
  "doc": "Imports help to reduce redundant FQNs.",
  "fields": [ {
    "name": "a",
    "type": "org.external.types.SomeType"
  }, {
    "name": "b",
    "type": "org.external.types.SomeType"
  }, {
    "name": "c",
    "type": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": "org.external.types.SomeType"
    }
  } ]
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
    <td>
{% highlight pdl %}
namespace com.example.models

import org.external.types.SomeType

/**
 * Imports help to reduce redundant FQNs.
 */
record Redundancies {
  a: SomeType,
  b: SomeType,
  c: array[SomeType]
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Shorthand for Custom Properties

Custom properties (also referred to as "annotations") were supported in PDSC as just arbitrary values keyed at anything that's not a reserved keyword.
In PDL, the syntax for custom properties is cleaner and more Java-like.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PDSC</th>
    <th>PDL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "namespace": "com.example.models",
  "type": "record",
  "name": "CustomProperties",
  "something": [ 1, 2, 3 ],
  "fields": []
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
    <td>
{% highlight pdl %}
namespace com.example.models

@something = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
record CustomProperties {}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Furthermore, PDL supports a path-like shorthand, where dot-separated keys can be used to specify nested custom properties.
Some property written as such:

```pdl
@prop = {
    "nested": {
        "foo": 1,
        "bar": 2
    }
}
```

May alternatively be written as such:

```pdl
@prop.nested.foo = 1
@prop.nested.bar = 2
```

One can easily imagine a scenario in which this would really come in handy:

```pdl
// Not so pretty...
@a = {
    "b": {
        "c": {
            "d": {
                "e": {
                    "f": "hello"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// That's better
@a.b.c.d.e.f = "hello"
```

Another interesting shorthand for custom properties is omission of an explicit value to indicate `true`:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PDSC</th>
    <th>PDL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "namespace": "com.example.models",
  "type": "record",
  "name": "ImplicitProperty",
  "truthy": true,
  "fields": []
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
    <td>
{% highlight pdl %}
namespace com.example.models

@truthy
record ImplicitProperty {}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Cleaner Enum Declarations

One major pain-point in PDSC is declaring enums with metadata such as doc strings, custom properties, and deprecation.
In PDSC schemas, this metadata must all be specified in individual mappings which are separate from the main symbol list.
In this way, defining complex enums in PDSC is unintuitive and can be hard to read and maintain.

On the other hand, PDL's syntax for defining enum symbol metadata is quite intuitive. Each doc string, custom property, and
deprecation annotation can be placed right alongside the symbol.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PDSC</th>
    <th>PDL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "type" : "enum",
  "name" : "Fruits",
  "symbols" : [ "APPLE", "BANANA", "PEAR", "PLUM" ],
  "symbolDocs" : {
    "BANANA" : "Comment for the BANANA symbol.",
    "PLUM" : "This symbol has been deprecated."
  },
  "deprecatedSymbols" : {
    "PLUM" : true
  },
  "symbolProperties" : {
    "PEAR" : {
      "someAnnotation" : false
    },
    "BANANA" : {
      "a" : {
        "b" : {
          "c" : 123
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
    <td>
{% highlight pdl %}
enum Fruits {
  APPLE,

  /**
   * Comment for the BANANA symbol.
   */
  @a.b.c = 123
  BANANA,

  @someAnnotation = false
  PEAR,

  /**
   * This symbol has been deprecated.
   */
  @deprecated
  PLUM
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Specifying Default Field Values

Although this is more of a _similarity_ than a difference, it should be noted that specifying default values for record
fields in PDL is the same as in PDSC. In both PDSC and PDL, default values are specified using the value's
[serialized JSON representation](/rest.li/how_data_is_serialized_for_transport). This may be confusing at first
because PDL is _not_ a JSON-like format, however field default values are still represented using JSON.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>PDSC</th>
    <th>PDL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "type" : "record",
  "name" : "Defaults",
  "namespace" : "com.example.models",
  "fields" : [ {
    "name" : "x",
    "type" : {
      "type" : "array",
      "items" : "int"
    },
    "default" : [ 1, 2, 3 ]
  }, {
    "name" : "y",
    "type" : {
      "type" : "map",
      "values" : "string"
    },
    "default" : {
      "key" : "value"
    }
  }, {
    "name" : "z",
    "type" : "SomeRecord",
    "default" : {
      "fieldA" : 1,
      "fieldB" : true
    }
  }, {
    "name" : "a",
    "type" : "SomeUnion",
    "default" : {
      "float" : 1.0
    }
  }, {
    "name" : "b",
    "type" : "SomeEnum",
    "default" : "SYMBOL1"
  } ]
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
    <td>
{% highlight pdl %}
namespace com.example.models

record Defaults {
  x: array[int] = [ 1, 2, 3 ],
  y: map[string, string] = { "key": "value" },
  z: SomeRecord = { "fieldA": 1, "fieldB": true },
  a: SomeUnion = { "float": 1 },
  b: SomeEnum = "SYMBOL1"
}
{% endhighlight %}
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Contributions to Pegasus are welcome!

To make the process as smooth as possible, we recommend following a few
guidelines:

-   Read our architecture and protocols.
-   Talk to us early on and ask questions! To avoid duplication of
    effort, let us know what you're planning to contribute before you
    write the code.
-   Set aside some time to respond to feedback. For all but the most
    trivial bug fixes, it is common to go through a few iterations of
    feedback on a proposed contribution.
-   Follow coding conventions, include documentation and write tests.
    Look to the surrounding code for examples.
-   Add a summary of your contribution to the top of the CHANGELOG file.

Contributions should be submitted as pull requests.

Usage: ./scripts/update-changelog [OPTION]...
This script should be run after bumping the project version in the gradle.properties file.
Running this script will perform the following modifications to the changelog:
  (1) Move everything under the "Unreleased" heading of the changelog to a new version heading.
  (2) Update and insert links as appropriate.
Note that the resulting modifications to the changelog should be committed along with the project version bump.
This script will fail if the project version hasn't been bumped. You should manually add to "Unreleased" if not bumping.

Options:
  -h, --help                    print this help text and exit

Examples:
  ./scripts/update-changelog    updates the changelog

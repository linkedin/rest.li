Usage: ./scripts/release [OPTION]... [TARGET_COMMIT]
Releases a new version of Rest.li by creating and pushing a tag at TARGET_COMMIT (defaults to HEAD). This script must be
run from the root project directory. TARGET_COMMIT must be an ancestor of master, unless the version being released is a
release candidate version.

Please note that the version used to create the tag will be the project version defined at HEAD, not at TARGET_COMMIT,
though this should be fixed in the future.

Options:
  -h, --help                    print this help text and exit.

Examples:
  ./scripts/release             create and push a release tag at HEAD
  ./scripts/release 0a1b2c3     create and push a release tag at commit 0a1b2c3
  ./scripts/release master^^    create and push a release tag at two commits before the head of master

 * A "marker" data schema for data that is itself a data schema (a "PDSC for PDSCs"). Because PDSC is not expressive enough to describe it's own format, this is only a marker, and has no fields. Despite having no fields, it is required that data marked with this schema be non-empty. Specifically, is required that data marked as using this schema fully conform to the PDSC format (https://github.com/linkedin/rest.li/wiki/DATA-Data-Schema-and-Templates#schema-definition).

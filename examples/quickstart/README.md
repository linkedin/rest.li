This is a standalone example that demonstrates a very simple RestLi
client and server. The code and logic behind it is described in detail
in:

https://github.com/linkedin/pegasus/wiki/Quickstart:-A-Tutorial-Introduction-to-RestLi

Please execute all commands below in the examples/quickstart folder

To build, use gradle 4.6 or greater.  If you need, you can run `../../gradlew wrapper` to generate a ./gradlew wrapper in this sample directory that will use gradle 4.6.  If you do
this, use `./gradlew` instead of `gradle` for the remainder of this README.

```
gradle publishRestliIdl
gradle build
```

The first line is required to initially propagate the pdsc and idl changes.  Subsequent builds can be run with only `gradle build`

You can then run the server with:

`gradle JettyRunWar`

Once running, you can send a GET request to the server with:

`curl -v http://localhost:8080/fortunes/1`

or run the client with

`gradle startFortunesClient`

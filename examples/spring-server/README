This is an example of using spring 3 dependency injection with rest.li.

There are many ways that servlets can be used with spring.  This takes one of the more common approaches.


To build, use gradle 1.6 or greater.  If you need, you can run ../gradlew wrapper to generate a ./gradlew wrapper in this sample directory that will use gradle 1.6.  If you do
this, use "./gradlew" instead of "gradle" for the remainder of this README.

Next, execute the following at the top level:

gradle -b api/build.gradle build
gradle build

The first line is required to initially propagate the pdsc and idl changes.  Subsequent builds can be run with only "gradle build".

You can then run the server with:

gradle JettyRunWar

Once running, you can send a GET request to the server with:

curl -v http://localhost:8080/server/fortunes/1

or run the client with

gradle startFortunesClient
